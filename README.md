# react-radial

Forked from original project by [Mode Lab](https://modelab.is)

## Intro

This is a straightforward, customizable radial menu, built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The radial component is built with SVG, and can be ported into a div, canvas, WebGL scene, etc. The demo file is an interactive environment for defining how you want the radial menu to look.
